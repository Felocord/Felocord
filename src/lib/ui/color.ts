//! This module is only found on 165.0+, under the assumption that iOS 165.0 is the same as Android 165.0.
//* In 167.1, most if not all traces of the old color modules were removed.
//* In 168.6, Discord restructured EVERYTHING again. SemanticColor on this module no longer works when passed to a stylesheet. We must now use what you see below.
//* In 173.10, Discord restructured a lot of the app. These changes included making the color module impossible to early-find.
// ? To stop duplication, it is now exported in our theming code.
// ? These comments are preserved for historical purposes.
